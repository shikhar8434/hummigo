  <h1>Hummigo</h1>
  <h3>An app for making lives of people with chronic disorders and prolonged diseases easier.</h3>
  <p>
    This project was created by us for the Google Developer Student Clubs Solution Challenge 2021. Google Developer Student Clubs Solution Challenge is an annual challenge hosted by Google developers, inviting college/university students from all over the world to learn & develop solutions for the given set of problems.</p>
  
  <p>
  Every year a different set of problems is given which can improve the lifestyle of common people and creates a positive impact on the society. The problem statements for DSC Solution Challenge 2021 are 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
  </p>

<p>We chose the "Good Health and Well-Being" United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to work upon.</p>
<h2>Why Hummigo?</h2>
    Despite advances in healthcare, 6 in 10 people continue to suffer from chronic illness. However such lifestyle diseases have their ultimate solution in the form of self help and routine management, and this is where our app, Hummigo, comes into picture. We developed “Hummigo”- an android app for self care and routine management.

<h2>Our contribution in creating a healthier and happier society</h2>
<p>We believe that regular monitoring of daily health and abiding strictly to medication and exercise discipline can greatly improve the conditions of people suffering from chronic disorders or prolonged dieases like diabetes, Parkinson's, High Blood Pressure. Easier monitoring and better anagement of daily health can prevent or at the very least, delay the progression of such diseases into their advanced stages. And therefore, we have come up with a one-stop solution for monitoring and better management of daily health. </p>
